# Feature 3.4.1: Tool Call Display

## Problem Statement

When the LLM agent executes tools, users have no visibility into what operations are being performed. This creates a "black box" experience where users must wait without understanding what's happening. Tool transparency is essential for:

1. Debugging - seeing which tools are called and with what parameters
2. Trust - users can verify the agent isn't performing unexpected operations
3. Context - understanding why certain results are produced

**Impact**: Without tool call visibility, users cannot effectively monitor, debug, or trust the agent's operations.

## Solution Overview

Implement PubSub broadcasting of tool call events from the Executor module, along with a formatting module to prepare tool calls for display. The actual TUI rendering will be implemented in Phase 4, but this task prepares all the infrastructure and formatting logic.

### Design Decisions

1. **PubSub Events**: Broadcast events to `"tui.events.{session_id}"` topic (same pattern as LLMAgent)
2. **Event Types**:
   - `{:tool_call, tool_name, params, call_id}` - when tool is invoked
   - `{:tool_result, result}` - when tool completes (includes full Result struct)
3. **Formatting Module**: Create `JidoCode.Tools.Display` for formatting tool calls and results for human consumption
4. **Truncation**: Long content (>500 chars) is truncated with "[...]" suffix for display

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Tool Display Formatter ✓
- [x] 1.1 Create `JidoCode.Tools.Display` module
- [x] 1.2 Implement `format_tool_call/3` for formatting tool invocation
- [x] 1.3 Implement `format_tool_result/1` for formatting Result struct
- [x] 1.4 Implement `format_params/1` for condensed parameter display
- [x] 1.5 Implement `truncate_content/2` for limiting long content
- [x] 1.6 Add syntax detection for code content highlighting hints

### Step 2: Add PubSub Broadcasting to Executor ✓
- [x] 2.1 Add `broadcast_tool_call/4` function in Executor
- [x] 2.2 Add `broadcast_tool_result/2` function in Executor
- [x] 2.3 Integrate broadcasts into `execute/2` function
- [x] 2.4 Accept optional `:session_id` in executor opts for topic routing
- [x] 2.5 Default to global "tui.events" topic when no session_id provided

### Step 3: Write Tests ✓
- [x] 3.1 Write Display module tests for formatting (30 tests)
- [x] 3.2 Write Executor broadcast tests using PubSub.subscribe (8 tests)
- [x] 3.3 Test truncation behavior
- [x] 3.4 Test error result formatting

### Step 4: Documentation and Finalization ✓
- [x] 4.1 Update phase-03.md with completed task
- [x] 4.2 Write summary document

## Technical Details

### File Structure
```
lib/jido_code/tools/
├── display.ex          # NEW - Tool call formatting
├── executor.ex         # MODIFIED - Add PubSub broadcasts
└── ...

test/jido_code/tools/
├── display_test.exs    # NEW - Display formatting tests
└── executor_test.exs   # MODIFIED - Add broadcast tests
```

### Event Message Format

```elixir
# Tool call event (broadcast when tool execution starts)
{:tool_call, tool_name, params, call_id}
# Example: {:tool_call, "read_file", %{"path" => "src/main.ex"}, "call_abc123"}

# Tool result event (broadcast when tool execution completes)
{:tool_result, %Result{
  tool_call_id: "call_abc123",
  tool_name: "read_file",
  status: :ok | :error | :timeout,
  content: "...",
  duration_ms: 45
}}
```

### Display Format Examples

```
# Tool call display
⚙ read_file(path: "src/main.ex")

# Tool result display (success)
✓ read_file [45ms]: defmodule Main do...

# Tool result display (error)
✗ read_file [12ms]: File not found: src/missing.ex

# Tool result display (timeout)
⏱ slow_operation [30000ms]: Tool execution timed out
```

## Success Criteria

1. Tool calls broadcast `{:tool_call, ...}` events via PubSub
2. Tool results broadcast `{:tool_result, ...}` events via PubSub
3. Display module formats tool calls and results for human consumption
4. Long content is truncated appropriately
5. All tests pass

## Current Status

**Status**: Complete
**What Works**: PubSub broadcasting from Executor, Display formatting module
**What's Next**: TUI integration in Phase 4
**How to Run**: `mix test test/jido_code/tools/display_test.exs test/jido_code/tools/executor_test.exs`

## Notes

- The actual TUI rendering components (3.4.1.3-3.4.1.8) will be implemented in Phase 4 when the TUI is built
- The toggle keybinding (Ctrl+T) requires TUI and will be Phase 4
- This task focuses on the data/messaging layer that the TUI will consume
