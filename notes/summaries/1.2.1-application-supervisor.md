# Summary: Task 1.2.1 - Application Supervisor Structure

## Overview

Implemented the OTP supervision tree structure with a DynamicSupervisor for managing agent processes.

## Changes Made

### New Files Created
- `lib/jido_code/agent_supervisor.ex` - DynamicSupervisor for agents
- `test/jido_code/application_test.exs` - 10 tests for supervision tree

### Modified Files
- `lib/jido_code/application.ex` - Added AgentSupervisor to children

### JidoCode.AgentSupervisor Module

**Public API:**
- `start_link/1` - Start the supervisor
- `count_children/0` - Get counts of active/worker/supervisor children
- `which_children/0` - List all child processes

**Configuration:**
- Uses DynamicSupervisor for runtime process spawning
- Strategy: `:one_for_one`
- Registered as `JidoCode.AgentSupervisor`

### Supervision Tree

```
JidoCode.Supervisor (one_for_one)
├── Phoenix.PubSub.Supervisor (JidoCode.PubSub)
├── Registry (JidoCode.AgentRegistry)
└── JidoCode.AgentSupervisor (DynamicSupervisor)
```

### Tests Added (10 tests)

**Supervision tree tests:**
- Application starts successfully
- PubSub is running
- AgentRegistry is running
- AgentSupervisor is running
- AgentSupervisor is a DynamicSupervisor
- AgentSupervisor starts with no children
- All 3 supervisor children are running

**PubSub functionality tests:**
- Can subscribe and receive messages

**Registry functionality tests:**
- Can register and lookup processes
- Registry enforces unique keys

## Verification

- `mix test` - 24 tests, 0 failures
- `mix run --no-halt` - Runs 5+ seconds without errors

## Notes

- PubSub, Registry were already configured in task 1.1.1
- AgentSupervisor added as third child
- Task 1.2.2 will add `start_agent/1` and `stop_agent/1` functions

## Next Steps

Task 1.2.2 - Agent Supervisor Implementation (start_agent/1, stop_agent/1)
